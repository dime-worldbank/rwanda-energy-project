# Formula used for power calculation

![Clustered sampling power calculation of sample size]("C:\Users\wb614406\OneDrive - WBG\Desktop\MTF Data\data\power_calculation.jpg")

We are using this formula to calculate the minimum detectable effect of outcomes using our number of sample size. The minimum detectable effect is the smallest effect size below which we might not be able to say an effect is statistically significant, or different from zero. 



#ICC and sample size


```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

d<- 0.2 # mde, observed effect
P<- 0.5 
n<-783 # number of households surveyed 
z<- 2.8 
signma_square <- 1
m<- 54 # number of villages/cluster

rho <- (d^2 * n * P * (1 - P) - z^2 * signma_square) / (z^2 * signma_square * (m - 1))


mde <- function(m, n, signma, base) {
  rho <- rho
  z <- 2.80
  P <- 0.66
  m <- m*0.75
  n <- n*0.75

  mde <- z * signma * sqrt((1 + rho * (m - 1)) / (n * P * (1 - P)))
  return(mde/base)
}

```

Using the WFP gender window data, we estimate the Inter-cluster correlation(ICC) for Rwandan villages as `rho`. This ICC will be used to calculate the power calculation for this project. 

The sample size of this project is 193 villages and 3860 households. There are four treatment arms, each treatment arm have around 48 villages.






# Explanation

## Well being

Standard deviation and minimum detectable effect come from the Lee et al. paper. Specifically the wellbeing measurement is in panel D: primary non-economic outputs- **D2 normalized life satisfaction**.


```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}


data <- data.frame(
  Category = c("round1", "round2", "pooled"),
  ITT = c(0.11, 0.22, 0.16),
  TOT = c(0.12, 0.29, 0.19)
)

kable(data, format = "pipe", caption = "Well being regression results from Lee et. al")
```



## Monthly Energy Spending

Standard deviation and minimum detectable effect come from the Lee et al. paper. Specifically the energy spending  measurement is in panel B: additional energy outcomes- **B8. Monthly total energy spending(USD)** & **B7. Monthly kerosene spending(USD)**. 



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(knitr)

data1 <- data.frame(
  Category = c("round1", "round2", "pooled"),
  Control = c(11.66, 9.98, 10.83),
  ITT = c(-0.35, -0.48, -0.36),
  TOT = c(-0.40, -0.01, -0.19)
)

kable(data1, format = "pipe", caption = "Monthly total energy spending(USD) regression results from Lee et. al")

```






## Monthly kerosene spending(USD)


Because the decrease of spending on total energy is not statistically significant, hereby runs the power calculation for monthly kerosene spending, which is statistically significant at 99%

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

library(knitr)

data2 <- data.frame(
  Category = c("round1", "round2", "pooled"),
  Control = c(2.81, 2.47, 2.64),
  ITT = c(-1.15, -0.63, -0.90),
  TOT = c(-1.20, -0.74, -1.00)
)

kable(data2, format = "pipe", caption = "Monthly total kerosene spending(USD) regression results from Lee et. al")

```





## Electricity Consumption


Standard deviation and minimum detectable effect come from the Lee et al. paper. Specifically the electricity consumption measurement is in **Table B7: Benchmarking average monthly electricity consumption in kWh and USD - Panel A: Newly connected households in sample**.

- Standard deviation: we are given Q1 and Q3, the standard deviation is calculated using the formula below. Sepcifically the standard deviation is taking the IQR of households that are newly connected in the sample and their consumption in 2016 (Round 1 survey)

![IQR estimation of sd]("C:\Users\wb614406\OneDrive - WBG\Desktop\MTF Data\data\IQR_SD.png")

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# After calculating the sd of both control and treatment group using their statistics from 2016, and from there calculating the pooled standard deviation for the population.

s2 <- (22-0)/1.349
s1 <- (76.4-30.9)/1.349
n2 <- 506
n1 <- 208

pooled_sd <- sqrt(((n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2) / (n1+n1-2))

# - Minimum detectable effect: because we only have the percentile of the data set for treatment(newly connected households in sample), and control(baseline connected households in sample), the effect of the subsidy and connection is imitated through comparing the difference in consumption increase rate for the two groups between 2016-2017 (which is time of the round1 and round2 survey)
# - The formula and result is: (T2017 - T2016)/T2016 - (C2017 - C2016)/C2016 = 0.39
# - Therefore I'm using the increase of 30%, 35%, and 40% for calculating sample size
# - The data could be found on page 101 of the Lee etal. pdf(A-57 in terms of page number)

# For this we ended up using s2, which is the R1 survey in 2016 result, this is used as baseline sd

```


```{r, echo=FALSE }
r1 <- (10.8-7.9)/7.9
r2 <- (72.3-74.1)/74.1
r_consumption <- r1-r2
```
