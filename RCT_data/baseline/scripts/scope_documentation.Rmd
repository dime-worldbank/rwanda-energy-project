#Scope selection criteria

If a village is in the scope of EDCL's surveyed LV line, and meet all of the following criteria, the village would be selected for the randomization scope.

## 1. No existing off-grid eligbility

- The village have no households that receives more than 95% subsidy for solar system in the eligibility tool
- The village is not on the priority list
- The village is not be labeled as “SAS”, “SAS 2023”, “Microgrid”  or “GE_Temporaly SAS”by nep revision list


```{r, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}

four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406 %>% 
  mutate(any_offgrid = case_when(
    et_sum != 0 | priority_0 == 0 ~ "partial",
    .default = "newly"
  ))

```


## 2. Minimal grid existence in the village

- The village have less than 100 meter LV and MV line combined within 200 meter of village boundary
- Village have no MV or LV line
- The village is labeled “GE” or “Fill In” by NEP revision list


```{r, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}
four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  mutate(
    any_grid = case_when(
      grid_status %in% c("newly") & nep_revision%in% c("GE", "Fill In")  ~ "newly",
      .default = "partial"
    )
  )
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1  %>% 
  mutate(status = case_when(
    any_grid == "newly" & any_offgrid == "newly" ~ "newly",
    .default = "partial"
  ))

table(four_district_2406.1$scope_2406)
```


## 3. Number of vulnerable households


- Previous version: Village must have at least 20 ubudehe_1 household
- Updated version 062624: Village must have at least 20 vulnerable hosueholds reported by district leaders


```{r, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}
four_district_2406.1  <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  mutate(
    status = ifelse(ubudehe_1 <20, "partial", status) # Or vulnerable <20
  )
```


## Number of Meters

- Village must have less than 30% meters

```{r, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}

four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  mutate(meter_percent = round(meter_eucl/total_hh, 2))

four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  mutate(
    status = ifelse(meter_percent >= 0.3 , "partial", status)
  )
```


## Number of Surveyed customers

- Village must have more than 20 surveyed customer according to scope of customer estimated by EDCL

```{r, warning= FALSE, results='hide'}

four_district_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  mutate(
    status = ifelse(customer < 20 , "partial", status)
  )

```





# Number of villages according to previous ubudehe_1 criteria

Villages selected must have more than 20 ubudehe_1 households

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

four_scope_2406.1 <- four_district_2406.1 %>% 
  filter( scope_2403 == 1)


scope_old <- four_scope_2406.1 %>% 
  filter(status == "newly") %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarise(
    village_n = n(),
    survey_hh= village_n * 20,
    readyboard_hh = sum(ubudehe_1)
  )


summary_row_old <- scope_old %>% 
  summarise(
    district = "Total",
    village_n = sum(village_n),
    survey_hh = sum(survey_hh),
    readyboard_hh = sum(readyboard_hh)
  )

scope_old <- bind_rows(scope_old, summary_row_old)

kable(scope_old, format = "pipe", caption = "Previous scope based on ubudehe_1")


```







# Number of villages according to updated vulnerable household criteria

villages selected must have more than 20 vulnerable households

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
